# Building a React Feedback App

This is a React.js project that allows users to create "feedback" posts. Users can view, add, edit, and delete posts. 

This project is credited to following the [React Front to Back 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/) Udemy course by [Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com/)

As a result, I am using concepts learn in this course to re-build my original [full-stack app capstone project](https://github.com/SuitcaseCoder/lexi-react-capstone) -> into an updated version: [Wem Oder Was - a react app to help German language learners](https://github.com/SuitcaseCoder/wem-oder-was)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Concepts Reviewed/Tools Used:
- React Basics
- JSX
- React Components, Props, and State
- React Forms -> CREATE, EDIT, DELETE
- Form validation
- React-Router-Dom for routing, redirects, & navigation
- Context API


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
